Sirin Stencil is a display humanist sans typeface
by Olga Karpushina with careful brush-inspired detailing.

It is designed for large sizes, but works surprizingly
well in small body copy, when its stencil gaps merge.

Sirin will work well on colored backgrounds
creating an optical 3D effect.

Sirin is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and 
could be expanded to support other scripts.
